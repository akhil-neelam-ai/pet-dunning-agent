## 🎬 Demo Script (5-7 minutes)

### Act 1: Set the Stage (1 min)

**What you say:**
> "PetDunning solves a $1.2 billion problem in veterinary healthcare. When pet owners' payments fail, traditional dunning systems treat everyone the same - whether the pet needs life-saving insulin or routine flea prevention. This leads to 20-30% involuntary churn and destroys customer relationships."

**What you show:**
- Point to the top metrics dashboard
- Highlight the "At-Risk Customers" table
- Call out Maria Rodriguez and Bella's diabetes condition

### Act 2: The AI Brain (2 min)

**What you say:**
> "Our AI agent makes risk-based decisions in real-time. Let me show you what happens when Maria's $50 payment fails."

**What you do:**
1. Select "Maria Rodriguez (Bella)" from sidebar
2. Click "🚨 Simulate Payment Failure"
3. Point to RIGHT PANEL as it populates

**What you highlight:**
- **Router Decision**: "CRITICAL RETENTION - Bella has Diabetes (high medical risk)"
- **Risk Score**: 0.9
- **Recommended Action**: offer_bridge_plan

**What you say:**
> "Notice the AI doesn't just retry the card. It sees Bella's medical urgency and overrides standard cancellation logic. Now watch the message it generates..."

### Act 3: Emotional Intelligence (1-2 min)

**What you show:**
- LEFT PANEL: The email message appears
- Read the first sentence aloud (emphasizing pet name + condition)

**What you say:**
> "This message is generated by Claude Sonnet 4.5. It's not a template - the AI crafts it contextually. Notice it mentions Bella by name, acknowledges her diabetes, and offers a solution: our $5 Bridge Plan."

**What you do:**
- Open sidebar > "Plan Comparison"
- Show Premium vs Bridge features
- Emphasize: "Keeps medical records + telehealth active for $5/mo"

### Act 4: The Conversation (2 min)

**What you say:**
> "Now I'll respond as Maria, who's facing temporary financial hardship."

**What you type:**
```
I can't pay until Friday, money is really tight this month
```

**What you show:**
1. Typing indicator appears
2. RIGHT PANEL updates with "Intent Extractor"
3. Point to: `intent: financial_hardship`, `confidence: 0.95`
4. AI generates response offering Bridge Plan details

**What you say:**
> "The AI understood her intent - not decline, not dispute, but hardship. So it explains the Bridge Plan in detail."

**What you type:**
```
Yes, please do the $5 plan
```

**What you show:**
1. RIGHT PANEL: `intent: accept_bridge`, Tool Executor calls Stripe
2. Balloons animation
3. Metrics update: Revenue Saved increases

**What you say:**
> "Success! Instead of losing $12,000 in lifetime value, we've kept Maria engaged at $5/mo. Our data shows 60% of Bridge Plan customers return to Premium within 6 months."

### Act 5: The Business Impact (1 min)

**What you show:**
- Top dashboard: Revenue Saved, Churn Prevented
- User table: Maria's status changed to "BRIDGE"

**What you say:**
> "Standard dunning recovers 40% of failed payments. Our AI recovers 70%+ by combining medical urgency with financial empathy. For Mars Veterinary Health, that's hundreds of millions in preserved LTV."

**Closing:**
> "This is the future of dunning - not punishing customers during hardship, but meeting them with intelligent compassion."
